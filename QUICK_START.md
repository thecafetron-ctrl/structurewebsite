```

## Customization Tips

### Change Colors
Edit `tailwind.config.js` and component files:
```typescript
// Example: Change gradient in any component
className="text-gradient"  // Silver to graphite
```

### Adjust Animation Speed
In any component, modify:
```typescript
transition={{ duration: 1.2 }}  // Make it slower/faster
```

### Modify Text
Each section component has its own content:
```typescript
// Example: Hero.tsx
<h1>Your Custom Headline</h1>
```
